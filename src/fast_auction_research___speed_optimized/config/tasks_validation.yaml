    **MARKET VALIDATION FOR A SINGLE LOT**

    Research this ONE lot and validate its market value:
    {lot_data}

    **ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY:**
    1. **Minimum Data Requirements**:
       - **8+ SOLD LISTINGS MINIMUM**: Recent sales with prices/dates
       - **8+ ACTIVE LISTINGS MINIMUM**: Current market pricing
       - **Only proceed if both minimums met**

    2. **Search Strategy (prioritise speed):**
       - Search eBay.co.uk sold listings FIRST — this single search should yield 8+ results for most items
       - Search eBay.co.uk active listings — should yield 8+ results
       - ONLY search Vestiaire Collective or The RealReal if eBay alone did not meet the 8 sold / 8 active minimums
       - Do NOT perform authentication verification searches at this stage — that is reserved for deep research
       - If minimums cannot be met after 4-5 searches, mark the lot as validation_failed and move on — do not keep searching

    3. **PLATFORM FEE ADJUSTMENTS FOR FMV CALCULATION:**
       When recording "sold for" prices, you MUST adjust for seller fees to get realistic resale value:
       - **Vestiaire Collective**: seller receives ~85% of "sold for" price (12% commission + 3% payment processing)
       - **eBay (business seller)**: seller receives ~87% of "sold for" price (~12.8% final value fee)
       - **eBay (private seller)**: seller receives ~100% of "sold for" price (no fees)
       - **The RealReal**: seller receives ~60% of "sold for" price (40-50% commission)
       Record BOTH the raw "sold for" price AND the calculated seller_net for each listing.
       Use the SELLER NET PROCEEDS (not the listed "sold for" price) when calculating FMV.

    4. **Initial Statistical Analysis**:
       - Calculate mean/median from seller net proceeds (not raw sold prices)
       - Assess condition variations in pricing
       - Market activity scoring (volume, recency)

    5. **Profit Potential Assessment**:
       - Initial FMV estimate based on seller net proceeds from 8+ sales
       - Quick margin calculation vs auction estimate
       - Market liquidity assessment
  expected_output: 'JSON object for this lot with: lot_number, title, initial_sales_data[]
    (8+ sold listings with platform, sold_price, seller_net_proceeds for each),

    **PROFIT CALCULATION FOR A SINGLE LOT** — using the market validation data from the previous task.

    **LOT DATA:** {lot_data}
    **BUYER'S PREMIUM DATA:** {buyer_premium_data}
    **PLATFORM FEE CHOICE:** {platform_fee_choice}

    **USE ACTUAL BUYER'S PREMIUM** from the buyer_premium_data — do NOT use a hardcoded rate.

    **PLATFORM FEE:**
    - If "3_percent_surcharge": add 3% of hammer price to acquisition cost
    - If "flat_fee_paid": do NOT add the 3% surcharge (user paid a flat registration fee)

    **ACQUISITION COST FORMULA:**
    total_acquisition_cost = HammerPrice × (1 + buyers_premium_rate) × (1 + VAT_rate_on_premium) + platform_fee + Shipping

    **MINIMUM PROFIT THRESHOLD (with 30% margin floor):**
    max( min(£200, 50% × total_cost), 30% × total_cost )

    **TWO SEPARATE CALCULATIONS (these are DIFFERENT numbers):**

    1. **expected_profit_margin** = (seller_net_FMV - total_cost_at_HIGH_estimate) / total_cost_at_HIGH_estimate × 100
       - The REAL profit opportunity assuming the lot sells at its HIGH estimate

    2. **max_safe_bid** = the highest hammer price where profit >= threshold
       - The user's BIDDING CEILING — a safety limit

    Output the complete financial analysis for this single lot.
  expected_output: 'JSON object for this lot including: lot_number, title,
    expected_profit_margin_pct, max_safe_bid (GBP), total_acquisition_cost_at_high_estimate,

    **COMPREHENSIVE DEEP MARKET RESEARCH FOR A SINGLE LOT**

    Research this ONE lot exhaustively:
    {lot_data}

    **RESEARCH METHODOLOGY:**

    1. **Image Matching**: Extract auction images, reverse search across platforms
    2. **Extensive Data Collection**:
       - **15+ SALES MINIMUM**: eBay sold, Vestiaire, RealReal, auction houses
       - **15+ ACTIVE LISTINGS MINIMUM**: Current market comparables
       - **Exception**: If <15 exist total, analyze ALL available

    3. **PLATFORM FEE ADJUSTMENTS FOR FMV CALCULATION:**
       When recording "sold for" prices, ALWAYS adjust for seller fees to get realistic resale value:
       - **Vestiaire Collective**: seller receives ~85% of "sold for" price (12% commission + 3% payment processing)
       - **eBay (business seller)**: seller receives ~87% of "sold for" price (~12.8% final value fee)
       - **eBay (private seller)**: seller receives ~100% of "sold for" price (no fees)
       - **The RealReal**: seller receives ~60% of "sold for" price (40-50% commission)
       Record BOTH the raw "sold for" price AND the calculated seller_net for each listing.
       Use the SELLER NET PROCEEDS when calculating comprehensive_market_value_estimate.

    4. **SOURCE TRACKING — MANDATORY:**
       For EVERY listing found, record: platform name, listing title, sold/asking price, seller_net_proceeds, URL link, and date.
       Organise sources by platform in the output so they can be displayed to the user.

    5. **Deep Statistical Modeling**:
       - Condition-adjusted pricing models (using seller net proceeds)
       - Geographic/seasonal variations
       - Confidence intervals & outlier analysis
       - Market liquidity & trend assessment
  expected_output: 'Comprehensive analysis for this lot: lot_number, title,
    sources: {"eBay": [{"title": "...", "sold_price": "£X", "seller_net": "£Y", "url": "...", "date": "..."}],
    "Vestiaire Collective": [...], "The RealReal": [...]},
    extensive_sales_data[] (15+ sales with seller_net), active_listings_data[] (15+ listings),
    statistical_analysis, condition_pricing_model,
    market_liquidity_score, comprehensive_market_value_estimate (GBP, based on seller net proceeds),
    high_confidence_valuation.

    **FINAL PROFIT ANALYSIS FOR A SINGLE LOT** — using comprehensive deep research data.

    **LOT DATA:** {lot_data}
    **BUYER'S PREMIUM DATA:** {buyer_premium_data}
    **PLATFORM FEE CHOICE:** {platform_fee_choice}

    **USE ACTUAL BUYER'S PREMIUM** from the buyer_premium_data — do NOT use a hardcoded rate.

    **PLATFORM FEE:**
    - If "3_percent_surcharge": add 3% of hammer price to acquisition cost
    - If "flat_fee_paid": do NOT add the 3% surcharge

    **ACQUISITION COST FORMULA:**
    total_acquisition_cost = HammerPrice × (1 + buyers_premium_rate) × (1 + VAT_rate_on_premium) + platform_fee + Shipping

    **RESALE VALUE:** Use the comprehensive_market_value_estimate from deep research (seller net proceeds).

    **TWO SEPARATE CALCULATIONS:**
    1. **expected_profit_margin** = (seller_net_FMV - total_cost_at_HIGH_estimate) / total_cost_at_HIGH_estimate × 100
    2. **max_safe_bid** = highest hammer price where profit >= max( min(£200, 50% × total_cost), 30% × total_cost )

    **CRITICAL:** Preserve the per-lot "sources" data from deep research for the final report.
  expected_output: 'JSON object for this lot with: lot_number, title,
    comprehensive_fmv_used (GBP), seller_net_fmv (GBP),
    expected_profit_at_high_estimate (GBP), expected_profit_margin_pct,
    max_safe_bid (GBP), total_acquisition_cost_at_high_estimate, ROI,
    fee_breakdown, min_profit_threshold_used,
    final_investment_recommendation (BUY/AVOID/MONITOR), sources{} preserved from deep research.

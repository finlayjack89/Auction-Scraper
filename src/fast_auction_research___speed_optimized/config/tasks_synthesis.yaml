    **FINAL PROFIT RANKING** — Rank all researched lots by expected_profit_margin descending.

    **ALL RESEARCHED LOTS:**
    {all_researched_lots}

    **BUYER'S PREMIUM DATA:** {buyer_premium_data}

    **TASKS:**
    1. Parse all per-lot results
    2. Sort by expected_profit_margin_pct DESCENDING (most profitable first)
    3. Assign final BUY/AVOID/MONITOR recommendations
    4. Preserve ALL per-lot sources{} data
    5. Calculate summary statistics (total opportunities, total potential profit, etc.)

    Output the ranked list as a JSON array.
  expected_output: 'JSON array of all lots SORTED BY expected_profit_margin_pct descending,
    each with: lot_number, title, expected_profit_margin_pct, expected_profit_at_high_estimate,
    max_safe_bid, total_acquisition_cost, comprehensive_fmv, seller_net_fmv, ROI,
    fee_breakdown, final_investment_recommendation, sources{}.
    Output inside a ```json code fence.'

    Process the final ranked opportunities and implement semantic deduplication
    to prevent duplicate entries. Create structured database records with all collected
    intelligence: source data, risk assessment, market valuation, financial analysis,
    and recommendations. Flag any items with expected_profit_margin > 20% for human review queue.

    **IMPORTANT: Preserve the expected_profit_margin ranking order (highest margin first)
    and the per-lot sources{} data — this data must pass through to the bidding sheet generation.**
  expected_output: 'Final processed dataset with deduplication report showing:
    total_items_processed, new_opportunities_identified, duplicates_filtered,
    high_value_opportunities flagged for review. Output must preserve per-lot sources{}
    and expected_profit_margin ranking order.'

    Transform the processed auction data into a mobile-optimized bidding sheet format AND save it to Box.com.

    **CRITICAL: RANK ALL LOTS BY expected_profit_margin — the REAL opportunity margin at the high estimate. Highest margin first, lowest last.**

    For each viable opportunity, display: lot number, item title, auction estimate range, market value estimate (seller net FMV), expected profit margin at high estimate, max safe bid (bidding ceiling based on max(min(£200, 50%), 30% floor) threshold), and the expected profit in GBP if bought at high estimate.

    Include clear BUY/AVOID/MONITOR recommendations with reasoning.

    **SOURCE DATA:** For each lot, include the research sources organised by platform. Output a JSON structure at the end of the bidding sheet with the following format:
    ```
    <!-- SOURCES_JSON_START -->
    [
      {
        "lot": "LOT_NUMBER",
        "title": "LOT_TITLE",
        "margin_pct": NUMBER_expected_profit_margin_at_high_estimate,
        "recommendation": "BUY/AVOID/MONITOR",
        "sources": {
          "eBay": [{"title": "...", "sold_price": "...", "url": "..."}],
          "Vestiaire Collective": [{"title": "...", "sold_price": "...", "url": "..."}],
          ...
        }
      },
      ...
    ]
    <!-- SOURCES_JSON_END -->
    ```

    Format the main bidding sheet for mobile viewing with clear visual hierarchy, emoji indicators, and essential information prioritised for quick scanning during live auction bidding.

    **IMPORTANT: After generating the bidding sheet, save it to Box.com with filename format: "AUCTION_BIDDING_SHEET_[DATE]_[TIME].md"**
  expected_output: "Mobile-friendly bidding sheet saved to Box.com as markdown file,
    with confirmation message including: \"SAVED TO BOX: [filename]\" followed by
    the bidding sheet content showing: \n\U0001F4F1 AUCTION BIDDING SHEET - [Date]\n\n**RANKED BY EXPECTED PROFIT MARGIN at high estimate (highest first):**\n\nFor

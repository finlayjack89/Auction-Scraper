    **RISK ASSESSMENT ON PRE-FILTERED LOTS**

    You are receiving a list of lots that have ALREADY been keyword-filtered by the system.
    The filtering is done — your job is ONLY risk assessment.

    **PRE-FILTERED LOTS (from system):**
    {filtered_lots_json}

    **YOUR TASK — RISK ASSESSMENT ONLY:**
    Check each lot's title and description for SPECIFIC red flag terms that indicate
    the item may be counterfeit, damaged beyond repair, or misattributed.

    **RED FLAG TERMS — REJECT only if these appear as MEANINGFUL indicators:**

    ALWAYS REJECT if the title/description contains:
    - "A/F" or "a/f" (auction shorthand for "as found" = untested/potentially broken)
    - "as found" (item sold in unknown/untested condition)
    - "sold as seen" (no returns, no guarantees)
    - "reproduction" (not an original)
    - "replica" (counterfeit or copy)
    - "spares or repair" / "spares or repairs" / "for parts" (broken item)
    - "faux" ONLY when describing the item's material as fake (e.g. "faux leather", "faux fur").
      Do NOT flag "faux" if it's part of a brand name or unrelated context.
    - "no guarantee" or "no warranty" relating to authenticity

    CONTEXT-DEPENDENT — Only reject when used as an ART/ANTIQUES ATTRIBUTION QUALIFIER:
    - "after [Artist Name]" — means a COPY of the artist's work (e.g. "after Rembrandt").
      Do NOT reject if "after" appears in normal English usage (e.g. "sought after",
      "named after", "after cleaning", "after market", etc.)
    - "style of [Artist/Maker]" — means NOT by that maker, just similar style.
      Do NOT reject if "style" describes a fashion/design style (e.g. "classic style",
      "Art Deco style handbag")
    - "school of [Artist]" — means from the artist's workshop/followers, not the artist
    - "manner of [Artist]" — similar to "after", means derivative work
    - "circle of [Artist]" — similar to "school of"
    - "attributed to" with disclaimers — only flag if paired with doubt language

    **CRITICAL RULES — READ CAREFULLY:**
    1. You are assessing LUXURY GOODS (handbags, watches, jewelry, designer items).
       These items almost NEVER use art attribution terms like "after", "style of", "school of".
       Be very careful not to reject luxury goods just because the word "after" or "style"
       appears somewhere in the description in normal English usage.
    2. When in doubt, PASS the lot. It is better to let a borderline lot through to
       market validation (which will catch bad investments) than to reject a profitable lot.
    3. Do NOT add lots that are not in your input.
    4. Do NOT re-apply keyword filtering (already done by the system).
    5. ONLY reject lots with CLEAR, UNAMBIGUOUS red flags.

    For each lot, assess risk and mark as:
    - PASS: No red flags found, safe to proceed
    - REJECT: Contains clear red flag terms — you MUST state the EXACT red flag term found
      and quote the relevant text from the title/description
    - FLAG: Minor concern but still worth researching (e.g. "slight wear", "minor scratches")

    **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
    You MUST output TWO sections:

    SECTION 1: A JSON array inside a ```json code fence containing ONLY the lots that
    PASSED or were FLAGGED (i.e. everything EXCEPT rejected lots).
    Each lot object should include all original fields plus: risk_assessment ("PASS" or "FLAG"), risk_notes.

    SECTION 2: After the JSON array, output a REJECTION REPORT listing every rejected lot
    with the specific reason. Use this exact format:

    RISK REPORT: [received] lots received, [passed] passed, [rejected] rejected, [flagged] flagged.

    REJECTED LOTS:
    - Lot [number]: "[title]" — REJECTED because: [exact red flag found and quoted text from listing]
    - Lot [number]: "[title]" — REJECTED because: [exact red flag found and quoted text from listing]
    ...

    If no lots were rejected, write: "REJECTED LOTS: None"
  expected_output: 'A JSON array inside a ```json code fence of lots that passed risk
    assessment. Each lot has all original fields plus risk_assessment and risk_notes.
    After the JSON, include: RISK REPORT: [received] lots received, [passed] passed,
    [rejected] rejected, [flagged] flagged. Then REJECTED LOTS section with specific
    justification for each rejection including the exact red flag term and quoted text.'

extract_item_details:
  description: |-
    **Process ONLY the risk-assessed lots** passed to you from risk_assessment_filtering.
    Do NOT add lots that were not in your input.

    For each lot in your input, parse titles and descriptions to identify:
    brand names, model numbers, materials (gold, silver, stainless steel, leather,
    etc.), size/dimensions, condition indicators, year/vintage markers, and any special
    features or attributes. Handle variations in spelling, abbreviations, and auction
    house terminology. Output clean, standardized data ready for market research.

    **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
    Output a JSON array inside a ```json code fence. Each lot object should include
    all original fields plus extracted details.

    **Your output must contain the SAME lots as your input — no additions, no removals.**
  expected_output: 'A JSON array inside a ```json code fence with extracted details
    added to each lot: extracted_brand, extracted_model, extracted_materials,
    extracted_condition, extracted_size, extracted_year, and confidence_scores for
    each extraction. Lot count must match input.'
